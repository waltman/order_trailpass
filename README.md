# order_trailpass

Script to send me an email reminding me to order a trailpass. I ran this
from a cronjob that kicked off on the 4th Monday of the month. The pass
I need to order is always two months out from the current month, so it
does a little date math to calculate that.

I'm not using this anymore. I still use trailpasses, but now I can order
them automatically through work. But I wanted to archive the project, and
after discussing this at PhillyPUG I wanted to make a Python version.
